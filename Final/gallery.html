                <p>My buddy, Oliver, was one of a litter of kittens that was found in a field on Big Ridge. They may have been abandoned by their mother or something happened to her, but were not in very good shape.  A cat rescue called SCRATCH, Inc. took them in and a foster mom bottle fed them and cared for them till they were ready for adoption.  My family adopted Oliver and his sister Felicity, but from the start Oliver was bonded to me and Felicity preferred to be an only cat. When I moved out,  I got to take Oliver with me, so now I have my best friend to keep me company.
